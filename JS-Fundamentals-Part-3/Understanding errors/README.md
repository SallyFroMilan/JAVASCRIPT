# Understanding errors

**Reading and understanding error messages** is a *requirement* as a developer.<br>
At first glance, many beginners shrink away from **error messages** as they appear to be **“scary”** and **difficult** to understand because they include terms one *may not be familiar with.*

However, error messages provide developers with a *treasure trove of knowledge*, and tell you everything you need to know about **how to resolve them!**

Being able to parse *error messages and warnings without fear* will enable you to:
<ul>
<li>effectively debug your applications</li>
<li>receive meaningful help from others</li>
<li>empower yourself to push forward when faced with an error.</li>
</ul>
