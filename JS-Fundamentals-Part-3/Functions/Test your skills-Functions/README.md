# DOM manipulation: considered useful

Some of the questions below require you to write some **DOM manipulation code** to complete them — such as creating new HTML elements, setting their text contents to equal specific string values, and nesting them inside existing elements on the page — all via **JavaScript**.

We haven't explicitly taught this yet in the course, but you'll have seen some examples that make use of it, and we'd like you to do some research into what DOM APIs you need to successfully answer the questions. A good starting place is our Manipulating documents tutorial.
