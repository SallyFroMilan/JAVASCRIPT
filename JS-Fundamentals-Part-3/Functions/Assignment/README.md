# Assignment 

Letâ€™s write some <strong>functions!</strong> Write these in the <em>script</em> tag of a skeleton <strong>HTML</strong> file.

For now, just write each <strong>function</strong> and test the output with <em>console.log.</em>

1. Write a function called <em>add7</em> that takes one number and returns that number + 7.
2. Write a function called <em>multiply</em> that takes 2 numbers and returns their product.
3. Write a function called <em>capitalize</em> that takes a string and returns that string with <em>only</em> the first letter capitalized. Make sure that it can take strings that are lowercase, UPPERCASE or BoTh.
4. Write a function called <em>lastLetter</em> that takes a string and returns the very last letter of that string:
<em>lastLetter("abcd")</em> should return <em>"d"</em>
