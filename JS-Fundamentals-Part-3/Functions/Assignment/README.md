# Assignment 

Letâ€™s write some <strong>functions!</strong> Write these in the <code>script</code> tag of a skeleton <strong>HTML</strong> file.

For now, just write each <strong>function</strong> and test the output with <code>console.log.</code>
<ol>
<li>Write a function called <code>add7</code> that takes one number and returns that number + 7.</li>
<li>Write a function called <code>multiply</code> that takes 2 numbers and returns their product.</li>
<li>Write a function called <code>capitalize</code> that takes a string and returns that string with <em>only</em> the first letter capitalized. Make sure that it can take strings that are lowercase, UPPERCASE or BoTh.</li>
<li>Write a function called <code>lastLetter</code> that takes a string and returns the very last letter of that string:
<ul>
<li><code>lastLetter("abcd")</code> should return <em>"d"</em></li>
</ul>
