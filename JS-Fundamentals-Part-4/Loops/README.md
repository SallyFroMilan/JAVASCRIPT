# Loops

Computers don’t get tired, and they’re really, really fast!<br>

For that reason, they are well suited to **solving problems** that involve doing *calculations multiple times*. In some cases, a computer will be able to **repeat** a task thousands or even millions of times in just a few short seconds where it might take a human many hours.<br>

One way to make a computer do a *repetitive task* is using a **loop**.<br>

## Why are loops useful?

<strong>Loops</strong> are all about doing <em>the same thing over and over again</em>: a way to <strong>repeat the same code multiple times</strong>.<br>

Often, the code will be slightly different each time round the loop, or the same code will run but with different variables.
