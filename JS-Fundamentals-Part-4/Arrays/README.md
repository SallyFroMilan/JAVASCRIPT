# Arrays

**Strings and numbers** may be our *building blocks*, but as your scripts get more complex, youâ€™re going to need a way to deal with **large quantities** of them.

Luckily, JavaScript has a couple of data types that are used for just that: 
<ul>
<li><strong>Arrays: a special type of objects.</strong></li>
</ul>

An array is simply an ordered collection of items (strings, numbers, or other things), a *special variable* which can hold **more than one value**.<br>

An array can hold **many values under a single name**, and you can access an array element by referring to an *index number*.<br>

*Do not forget* that it's a common practice to declare arrays with the **const** keyword.
