# JS-Fundamentals-Part-4

One of the *challenges of programming* is: dealing with **large amounts of data.**

In this lesson you’ll learn about:
<ul>
<li><strong>Arrays</strong> - <em>data structures</em> that can <strong>store multiple values in a single variable.</strong><br>
They are very useful for <strong>organizing and manipulating large amounts of data.</strong></li>
</ul>

You’ll also learn about:
<ul>
<li><strong>Loops</strong> - <em>control structures</em> that allow you to <strong>execute a block of code repeatedly.</strong><br>
Very handy for <strong>performing the same operation on each element of an array.</strong></li> 
</ul>

Finally, you’ll be introduced to:
<ul>
<li><strong>Test-Driven Development (TDD)</strong> - the practice of <strong>writing tests for your code before you write the code itself.</strong></li>
</ul>
