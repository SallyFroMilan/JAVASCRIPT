# Test Driven Development

It refers to the *practice of writing automated tests* that describe **how your code should work** *before* you actually write the code.

For example, if you want to write a function that adds a couple of numbers, you would first write a test that uses the function and supplies the expected output. The test will fail before you write your code, and you should be able to know that your code works correctly when the test passes.

In many ways, **TDD** is *much more productive* than writing code without tests. If we didnâ€™t have the test for the adding function above, we would have to run the code ourselves over and over, plugging in different numbers until we were sure that it was working.
