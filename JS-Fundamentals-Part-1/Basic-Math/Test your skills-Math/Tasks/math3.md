# Math task 3 

In the final task for this article, we want you to write some tests.

You've got three groups, each consisting of a statement and two variables. For each one, write a test that proves or disproves the statement made. Store the results of those tests in variables called <em>weightComparison</em>, <em>heightComparison</em>, and <em>pwdMatch</em>, respectively.
