# Basic Math

### Numbers - the building blocks of programming logic! & how to apply some basic math in JavaScript.

# Math task 1

### Let's start out by testing your knowledge of basic math operators. 

You will have to create four numeric values, then add the first two together, then subtract the fourth from the third, then multiply the two secondary results together to get a result of 48. Finally, we need to write a test that proves that this value is an <em>even number.</em>

So, try updating the starting point for this task to recreate the finished example, following these steps:

1. Create four variables that contain numbers. Call the variables something sensible.

2. Add the first two variables together and store the result in another variable.

3. Subtract the fourth variable from the third and store the result in another variable.

4. Multiply the results from the last two steps together, storing the result in a variable called <em>finalResult.</em> The product should be 48. If it isn't, you'll have to adjust some of the initial input values.

5. Finally, write a calculation that checks whether <em>finalResult</em> is an even number. Store the result in a variable called <em>evenOddResult.</em>
