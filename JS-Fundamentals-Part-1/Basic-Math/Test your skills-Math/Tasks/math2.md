# Math task 2 

In the second task you are already provided with two calculations, with the results stored in the variables <em>result</em> and <em>result2.</em>But these results aren't what we want; you'll need to take the calculations and change them to give us what we want.

What do we want? After multiplying the two results together and formatting the result to 2 decimal places, the final result should be 10.42.

Try updating the starting point to recreate the finished example, following these steps:

1. Write a calculation that multiplies <em>result</em> and <em>result2</em> together and assigns the result back to <em>result.</em> This will require assignment shorthand.

2. Write a line of code that takes result and formats it to 2 decimal places, storing the result of this in a variable called <em>finalResult.</em>

3. Check the data type of <em>finalResult</em> using <em>typeof;</em> you'll probably see that it is actually of <em>string</em> type! Write a line of code that converts it to a <em>number</em> type, storing the result in a variable called <em>finalNumber.</em>

4. The value of <em>finalNumber</em> needs to be <em>10.42.</em> Go back and update the original calculations you were provided with so that they give this final result. Don't update the numbers or the operators.
