# Arithmetic operators

**Arithmetic operators** are the **basic operators** that we use to do **sums** in <em>JavaScript.</em>

We probably don't need to teach you **how to do basic math**, but we would like <em>to test your understanding</em> of **the syntax** involved.<br>
Try entering the <em>examples</em> below into your **developer tools JavaScript console** to <em>familiarize</em> yourself with the **syntax.**

<p>1. First try entering some simple examples of your own, such as:
<p>10 + 7;<br>
9 * 8;<br>
60 % 3;

<p>2. You can also try declaring and initializing some numbers inside variables, and try using those in the sums â€” the variables will behave exactly like the values they hold for the purposes of the sum. For example:

<p>const num1 = 10;<br>
const num2 = 50;<br>
9 * num1;<br>
num1 ** 3;<br>
num2 / num1;</p>

<p>3. Last for this section, try entering some more complex expressions, such as:

<p>5 + 10 * 3;<br>
(num2 % 9) * num1;<br>
num2 + num1 / 8 + 2;</p>
