# Useful Number methods

The <em>Number object</em>,  an instance of which represents all standard numbers you'll use in your JavaScript, has a number of useful methods available on it for you to manipulate numbers. We don't cover these in detail in this article because we wanted to keep it as a simple introduction and only cover the real basic essentials for now.

For example, to round your number to a fixed number of decimal places, use the <em>toFixed()</em> method. Type the following lines into your browser's console: 

<p>const lotsOfDecimal = 1.766584958675746364;<br>
lotsOfDecimal;<br>
const twoDecimalPlaces = lotsOfDecimal.toFixed(2);<br>
twoDecimalPlaces;</p>
