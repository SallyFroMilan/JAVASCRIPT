# Useful Number methods

The *Number object*,  an instance of which represents **all standard numbers you'll use in your JavaScript**, has a number of useful methods available on it for you to **manipulate numbers.**<br>
We don't cover these in detail in this article because we wanted to keep it as a simple introduction and only cover the real basic essentials for now.

For example, **to round your number to a fixed number of decimal places**, use the *toFixed()* **method.**<br>
Type the following lines into your browser's console: 

<code>const lotsOfDecimal = 1.766584958675746364;<br>
lotsOfDecimal;<br>
const twoDecimalPlaces = lotsOfDecimal.toFixed(2);<br>
twoDecimalPlaces;</code>
