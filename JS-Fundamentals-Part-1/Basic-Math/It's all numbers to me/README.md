#### Let's quickly play with some numbers to reacquaint ourselves with the basic syntax we need. Enter the commands listed below into your developer tools JavaScript console.

1. First of all, let's declare a couple of variables and initialize them with an integer and a float, respectively, then type the variable names back in to check that everything is in order:

<p>const myInt = 5;<br>
const myFloat = 6.667;<br>
myInt;<br>
myFloat;</p>

2. Number values are typed in without quote marks — try declaring and initializing a couple more variables containing numbers before you move on.

3. Now let's check that both our original variables are of the same datatype. There is an operator called <em>typeof</em> in JavaScript that does this. Enter the below two lines as shown:

<p>typeof myInt;<br>
typeof myFloat;</p>

You should get <em>"number"</em> returned in both cases — this makes things a lot easier for us than if different numbers had different data types, and we had to deal with them in different ways. Phew!
