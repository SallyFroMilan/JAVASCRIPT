# Conditionals 1 

In this task you are provided with <strong>two variables</strong>:

- <em>season</em> — contains a <strong>string</strong> that says <strong>what the current season is.</strong>
- <em>response</em> — begins uninitialized, but is later used to store a response that will be <strong>printed to the output panel.</strong>

We want you to create a <strong>conditional</strong> that checks whether <em>season</em> contains the <strong>string "summer"</strong>, and if so assigns a <strong>string</strong> to <em>response</em> that gives the user an <strong>appropriate message about the</strong> <em>season.</em>

If not, it should assign a <strong>generic string</strong> to <em>response</em> that tells the user <strong>we don't know what</strong> <em>season</em> <strong>it is.</strong>

To finish off, you should then add another test that checks whether <em>season</em> contains the <strong>string "winter"</strong>, and again assigns an appropriate <strong>string </strong>to <em>response<em>.
