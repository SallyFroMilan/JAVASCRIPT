# Making decisions in your code â€” conditionals

In any <em>programming language</em>, <strong>the code</strong> needs to <em>make decisions</em> and <em>carry out actions</em> accordingly depending on <strong>different inputs.</strong>

<strong>Conditional statements</strong> allow us to represent such decision making in <strong>JavaScript</strong>, from the choice that must be made, to the resulting outcome of those choices.
