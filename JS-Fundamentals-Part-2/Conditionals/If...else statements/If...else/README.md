# A real example

To <em>better understand</em> this <strong>syntax</strong>, let's consider a real <em>example.</em>

Imagine a child being asked for help with a chore by their mother or father. The parent might say <em>"Hey sweetheart! If you help me by going and doing the shopping, I'll give you some extra allowance so you can afford that toy you wanted."</em> 

In <strong>JavaScript</strong>, we could represent this like so:</em>

<p>let shoppingDone = false;<br>
let childsAllowance;</p>

<p>if (shoppingDone === true) {<br>
  childsAllowance = 10;<br>
} else {<br>
  childsAllowance = 5;<br>
}</p>

This <strong>code</strong> as shown always <strong>results</strong> in the <em>shoppingDone</em> <strong>variable</strong> returning <em>false</em>, meaning disappointment for our poor child. It'd be up to us to provide a mechanism for the parent to set the <em>shoppingDone</em> <strong>variable</strong> to <em>true</em> if the child did the shopping.
