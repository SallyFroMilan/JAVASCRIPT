## Calculator

Our **final project** is going to combine everything you’ve learned so far: you’re going to make an *on-screen calculator using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS***.

As usual there are elements of this project that *are not* going to be trivially easy for you, but if you’ve been following the course so far, you definitely have everything you need to finish it. We’re going to walk you through the various steps you can take, but again, how you actually implement them is up to you!
